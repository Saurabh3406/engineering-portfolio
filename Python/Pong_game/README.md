# üèì Pong Game in Python (Inspired by IBM's ML Course)

This is a classic Pong game created using **Python** and **Pygame**, inspired by my learning journey through IBM's [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) course. While the current version is fully rule-based, the goal is to integrate **machine learning** into the paddle mechanics in future iterations.

## üéÆ Features

- Two-player Pong gameplay
  - Player 1: Keyboard (Up/Down arrows)
  - Player 2: Mouse (vertical movement)
- Ball bounces off paddles and top/bottom walls
- Scorekeeping for both players
- Game resets when a player scores
- 60 FPS smooth animation with Pygame

## üöÄ What's Next?

I plan to:
- Train a machine learning model to control one of the paddles
- Experiment with **Reinforcement Learning** or **Supervised Learning**
- Add adaptive difficulty or self-learning gameplay

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.13.5
- Pygame

---

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install Pygame** if not already installed:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

2. Run the game:
```bash
python pong_game.py
```

3. Controls:
Player 1: Up / Down arrow keys
Player 2: Mouse vertical movement

4. Inspiration
This project was motivated by IBM's Machine Learning with Python course on Coursera. As I progress in learning model training and evaluation, I will build on this foundation to integrate intelligent behavior into the gameplay.
